# Design Study Knowledge Map
See website on :https://odumbledorearmyo.github.io/Design-Study-Knowledge-Map

It's a knowledge map about the field of design study. It will provide a quick inquiry by using Neo4j graph database. This project use d3.js to visualize the map on web page. 

### Data source
The database is create by myself based on literature review. So basically it's a personal knowledge database. The database is recorded as Cypher in the txt file. If you want to modify the data, copy the code in the txt file to Neo4j and the database will be created locally. Then modify them in Neo4j as you like. But remember to run the Match2D3.java again after modifying the data, so the map will change to show your database. The database will keep updating.

### Tech stack
Neo4j(Cypher) + Java API + D3.js + HTML

### Future work
(1) Fix the problem â€” the duplicate nodes remains visible.  (Done!)

(2) Provide an English version.

(3) UI for inquiring the nodes and the relationships.

Believe it or not, I'm working on it!
