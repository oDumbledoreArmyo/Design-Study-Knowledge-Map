See website on :https://odumbledorearmyo.github.io/Design-Study-Knowledge-Map

It's a knowledge map about the field of design study. It will provide a quick inquiry by using Neo4j graph database. This project use d3.js to visualize the map on web page. 

### Data source
All the data are create by myself based on literature review. So basically it's a personal knowledge database. 

### Tech stack
Neo4j(Cypher) + Java API + D3.js + HTML

### Future work
(1) Fixed the problem â€” the duplicate node remains visible.  

(2) Provide an English version.

(3) UI for inquiring the nodes and the relationships.

Believe it or not, I'm working on it!
